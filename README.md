# googauth

This repository holds a command line tool ([googauth](./googauth)),
as well as a library ([googauth-lib](./googauth-lib)).

It tries to solve the problem of getting a Google user's access or id token
in a rust program programmatically, or on the command line using the `googauth` command.

Pull requests are welcome.

# How to use the library

Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
googauth-lib = "0.6.0"
```

# How to use the application

## Features

* Profiles: save each login in a named profile.
* Cache: Each profile saves the last access and id token for ease of use.
* Refresh token: automatically fetches a new (access/id) token if the current one has expired.
* Pipeable: Most commands are designed to be used as the input to other command line programs by the use of pipes.
* User friendly: The goal is to provide decent error messages.

## Help

Using the help section of the program should get you started.

```
./googauth help
```

Every required command parameter can be provided using a long form `./googauth --long "mylong"`,
a short form `./googauth -s "myshort"`, as well as an environment variable `ENV="myenv" ./googauth [...]`. 

## Login

Use the login command with a profile name and parameter values for all the required parameters.

```
./googauth login myprofile \
   --scopes "scope1,scope2,scope3" \
   --id "my_client_id" \
   --secret "my_client_secret"
```

At this point your default browser should start and you can login to your Google account.

If the browser doesn't start, you can use the URL that is printed to the terminal.

## Access token

```
./googauth accesstoken myprofile

<ACCESS TOKEN ON STANDARD OUT>
```

## ID Token

```
./googauth idtoken myprofile

<ID TOKEN ON STANDARD OUT>
```
